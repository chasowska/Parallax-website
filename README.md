I'm moving on to the next task, which seems quite interesting to me because I've noticed this effect
on various websites before, and only now I understand how to create it myself. In the future, I plan
to learn how to create more complex websites with this effect. For now, though, I need to grasp the
basics and move on to the next equally interesting tasks.

The task for the challenge, as before, was taken
from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/html-and-css-code-challenges-for-beginners/).
It reads as follows:

### Create a parallax website

A parallax website has a fixed image in the background that stays in place while you scroll through
other parts of the page. Itâ€™s a popular effect in web design and gives an elegant look and feel to a
page.

1. Design a parallax webpage.
2. Divide the page into three or four sections.
3. Set three or four background images and align text to each section.
