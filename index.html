    <h2>Ukraine</h2>
    <p>We live in a beautiful country — Ukraine. It is renowned for its fertile lands with rich
        harvests and magnificent nature. The towering peaks of the Carpathians, their beech forests,
        the fertile lands of central Ukraine, the bright sun of Crimean resorts, the famous
        Slobozhanshchyna — this is all our country. The borders of the modern Ukrainian state were
        established in 1991, when the country restored independence. They are internationally
        recognized, and have not changed since, despite any claims that Russia makes regarding the
        territories it occupied using military force.
        The Ukrainian borders and territories are not subject to any negotiation. To establish just
        and long-lasting peace and restore the validity of international law, Russia must withdraw
        all its troops from Ukraine, and the legitimate state border must be restored. </p>

    <h2>Beginning</h2>
    <p>Russia-Ukraine War, war between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2014 with the
        covert invasion of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea by disguised Russian troops.
        The conflict expanded in April 2014 when Russians and local proxy forces seized territory in
        Ukraine’s Donbas region; over the next seven years, more than 14,000 people would be killed
        in fighting in eastern Ukraine.
        On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Although Russian
        forces made significant gains in the first days of combat, Ukrainian defenders rebuffed
        attempts to seize Kyiv and other major cities and were soon launching counterattacks at
        Russian positions.</p>

    <h2>People</h2>
    <p>Millions of Ukrainians fled the country as Russia indiscriminately targeted civilian
        populations with rockets and artillery strikes. An estimated eight million people fled
        Ukraine and nearly that many were internally
        displaced; in total, more than one-third of Ukraine’s population was displaced by the
        fighting. The Russian military also carried out the forcible transfer of between 900,000 and
        1.6 million Ukrainian citizens (including some 260,000 children) to Russian territory; this
        constituted a clear war crime under the Fourth Geneva Convention. The mass kidnapping and
        “filtration” of Ukrainians in Russian-occupied territory was part of a broader campaign of
        ethnic cleansing that recalled similar Russian efforts in Chechnya and Georgia. In March
        2023 the International Criminal Court concluded that Russia’s mass kidnapping campaign
        constituted a war crime under the terms of the Rome Statute.</p>

    <h2>Defenders</h2>
    <p>The enemy destroys Ukrainian cities and kills Ukrainian civilians every day. The best sons
        and daughters of Ukraine continue to fight at the cost of their lives. Every soldier
        defending our country from Russian invaders is undoubtedly a hero. Thanks to them, Ukraine
        has been able to preserve its independence in these difficult times, and millions of
        Ukrainians have hope for the future. Everyone in Ukraine dreams about victory — the victory
        of life, dignity, freedom. From the
        Chernihiv region to Crimea, from the Donetsk region to the Zakarpattia region. We are all
        united to win.</p>
